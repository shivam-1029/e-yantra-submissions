# File Description: < This Verilog module defines a simple 2-input AND gate.
                      The module takes two 1-bit inputs (a and b) and produces 
                      a 1-bit output (out) based on the AND logic operation. >
# Global variables: < None >
*/

    input b,
 // < b >: < Second 1-bit input to the AND gate >
    output out
 // < out >: < 1-bit output representing the result of the AND operation on inputs a and b >
);

/*
Purpose:
---
This section of code implements the AND gate logic by assigning the output 'out' 
to be the result of the bitwise AND operation on inputs 'a' and 'b'.
